*Welcome to Crystal Collector

Your objective is to match the total value of your crystals
to that of the Master Crystal.

On the outset of each round, the Master Crystal is assigned
a random value, as are each of the four crystals below.

To win a round, you must collect crystals by clicking on
them. The value of each crystal is hidden from you. Each
time you collect one, its value will be added to your total.
If the total value of your crystals equals that of the 
Master Crystal, you win that round and your wins increase
by one.
If the total value of your crystals exceeds that of the 
Master Crystal, you lose that round and your losses increase
by one.

Have fun and good luck!
